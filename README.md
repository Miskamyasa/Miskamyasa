Full-stack dev (FrontEnd-leaning) with solid backend chops. I ship responsive web apps + mobile solutions without letting code quality decay into spaghetti.

I build end-to-end systems, run code reviews, and turn business requirements into actual technical specs that don’t implode at runtime.

UX matters for me the most. I work closely with ui/ux to make interfaces feel coherent, not accidental.
