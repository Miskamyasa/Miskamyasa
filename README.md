With over 10 years as a Full Stack (Frontend oriented) Developer, I combine strong backend skills with frontend mastery. I deliver responsive web applications and mobile solutions while maintaining high code quality standards. 

My work includes building complete solutions, conducting code reviews, and translating business requirements into technical specifications. 

I'm passionate about perfect user experience, working closely with UI/UX teams to create seamless interfaces. 

I aim to use my full-stack skills in a team environment where I can contribute across the entire technology stack.
